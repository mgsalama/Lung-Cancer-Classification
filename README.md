# Lung Cancer Classification
Practice personal project working with data science and machine learning libraries in a Python Jupyter Notebook.

Main datasets regarding lung cancer and related health attributes taken from Kaggle users Mysar Ahmad Bhat and The Devastator. Original datasets can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/lung-cancer) and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/cancer-patients-and-air-pollution-a-new-link), respectively.

My first major personal machine learning project with Python libraries, where I heavily documented and narrated my thought process throughout the exploration and classification. This was my beginner exploration of the machine learning libraries, such as scikit-learn. I wanted to explore these capabilities in further depth, so if you're interested in that, take a look at my [sleep health project here](https://github.com/mgsalama/Sleep-Health-ML) (still in progress).
